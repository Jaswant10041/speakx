QuestSearch is a project that provides a search functionality through filtering data from database for given query string in the search box. It utilizes Node.js for the backend, gRPC for communication, React for the frontend, MongoDB for data storage, and tailwindcss for styling.I implemented pagination for better user experience and this project will support both mobiles and pc's.
